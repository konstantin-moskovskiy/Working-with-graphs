# Working-with-graphs
This repository contains solutions to some graph structure tasks

## Task 1

For a given undirected network:
>1. Find the number of nodes and edges of the network, the average degree of a vertex in the network.
>2. Find the number of vertices whose degree is greater than the average.
>3. Construct a histogram of the distribution of degrees of vertices.
>4. For the largest connected component of the graph, calculate the radius, diameter, 90th percentile of the distance between the vertices.

## Task 2

For the largest component of the weak connectivity of the Vkontakte network:
>1. Calculate metrics: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality.
For each metric found, output 10 vertices that have the maximum metric value.
>2. Calculate the cosine measure of the proximity of the vertices of the network by the adjacency matrix. Print the 10 vertices closest to each other.
>3. Analyze the received metrics. Do the resulting lists of vertices with maximum centrality metrics differ and why? Do the centrality metrics differ for close vertices?

## Task 3

For an undirected graph with unit edge weights:
>1. Find the number of vertices, edges, density, the number of connectivity components, the proportion of vertices in the maximum capacity of the connectivity component.
>2. Find the number of vertices whose degree is greater than the average.
>3. For the largest component of connectivity, find the values of the radius, the diameter of the network, the 90th percentile of the distance between the vertices of the graph. 
The evaluation is based on calculating the distances between 500 randomly selected vertices from the largest component of connectivity.
>4. Find the number of triangles in the network, the average and global cluster coefficients.
>5. Construct a distribution density function (PDF) for an undirected graph with unit weights of edges of degrees of vertices in the network in the usual and log-log scales. 
Find the minimum, maximum and average degree of the node.
>6. Using the least squares method, approximate the constructed distribution density functions of the degree of vertices of the graph in log-log scales by a linear function. 
Compare the original distribution function with its approximation in conventional scales.
